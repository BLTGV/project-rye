# Contract: SQL surface

Published by **schema**. Consumed by **admin** and **agent-kit**.

The `rye` schema is the only shared state in the system; everything else is a
client of it. This contract says what a client may depend on.

## Shape

- **Objects.** Six core tables, the supporting tables, the read views
  (`current_valid_assertions`, `node_context`, `review_queue`,
  `competing_candidates`, `stale_digests`, `open_gaps`, `assertion_support`,
  `current_assertions_weighted`), and the helper functions. Full inventory in
  `docs/data-dictionary.md`; normative behaviour in
  `design/model/core-contract-and-conformance.md`.
- **Writes go through helpers**: `record_event`, `record_assertion`,
  `accept_assertion`, `reject_candidate`, `supersede_assertion`,
  `record_distillation`, `schedule_assertion_change`, `resolve_knowledge_gap`,
  `record_artifact`, `link_record`, `link_records_batch`, `track_table`,
  `merge_nodes`. A client never inserts into `events` and
  `event_participants` separately, and never updates an assertion's content,
  status, or basis.
- **Reads are views and `SELECT`-returning functions**: `rye_catalog()`,
  `rye_agent_context()`, `rye_categories()`, `agent_node_summary()`, and the
  views above. `rye_categories()` has its own contract,
  `contracts/category-vocabulary.md`, which governs its jsonb shape.
  Base-table reads carry no promise beyond the data dictionary's columns.
- **Extension points are values, not DDL.** New `node_type`, `edge_type`,
  `assertion_type`, and property keys need no migration.
- **Authorization is session variables**: `app.current_role`,
  `app.current_user_id`, `app.current_teams`, set in the same statement as
  the query when the connection is pooled. Nothing else authorizes.

## Versioning

Applied migrations are recorded by filename in `public.rye_migrations`. A
client asks `rye_catalog()` what exists rather than assuming a version.
Migrations are forward-only and additive: a new numbered file may add tables,
columns, views, functions, and overloads, and an applied file is never
edited. Removing or renaming an object, narrowing a function signature, or
changing a view's column meaning is breaking and requires a decision record
and an edit here first. There are no down migrations.

## Freshness

Synchronous within the transaction: a helper's effect is visible to the next
statement on the same connection. Two exceptions — profile materialized views
are stale until `refresh_materialized_views()` runs, and CDC events only
exist for tables passed to `track_table()`.

## Failure behavior

- A refused write raises, and clients surface the message rather than
  retrying. Refusals are load-bearing: teams without a classification, an
  assertion without evidence when basis is not `assumed`, a supersession
  across subjects, a term outside the scope's enabled plugins.
- RLS failures are silent by construction: an invisible node yields zero rows,
  not an error, so a client reading zero rows must not conclude the row is
  absent. `INSERT ... RETURNING` on RLS-protected tables fails; use the helper.
- No path in this contract deletes an event or mutates an accepted assertion
  in place.
